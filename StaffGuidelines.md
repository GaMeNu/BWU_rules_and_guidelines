# <<-- Build With Us Mod guidelines (Revision 2)-->>

Applies to all staff members!

Notice: These guidelines are subject to change at any time! Please be sure to update on them every once in a while.

## **__1) General guidelines__**

__1.1) Following the rules:__ Normal rules still apply to staff members! Be sure to follow the normal rules!

__1.2) Discord server:__ Being a part of the Build With Us Discord server is required to be a staff member on the plot, as it is where we exchange information and communicate outside of the plot. Please make sure to join the Discord server and update on it every once in a while.

__1.3) Staff abuse:__ Abusing your powers as staff member (for example: banning/kicking players without a proper reason, using your powers to grief/annoy too much) may result in you getting demoted or banned from the plot.

__1.4) Over-punishment:__ Punishing players for little things or giving a punishment which is a lot harder than the fitting punishment may result in you getting demoted. (See also Section 2: Proper actions and punishments).

__1.5) Inactivity:__ Being inactive for too long on the plot may result in you getting demoted.

__1.6) Proper reasoning:__ Make sure to properly add a clear reason for each ban, tempban, or warn you issue, to prevent confusion and misunderstandings. Otherwise you might get demoted.

__1.7) Banlist/Warnlist flooding:__ Do not fill the banlist or the warnlist with unnecessary bans. For example, if you have banned a nonexistent player as a joke, be sure to unban them afterwards. Over-flooding the lists may result in you getting demoted.

__1.8) Punishment alteration:__ You may go a little over or under the punishments specifically mentioned in section 2, but do not give too harsh or too weak punishments. These guidelines aren't meant to be followed one-to-one but rather to be flexible and give general directions of how to punish and on what.

__1.9) Incapability to punish:__ If you have found a player breaking the rules but you are unable to give the proper punishment (for example: you are a JrMod and you saw a player griefing), warn the player using `@warn`, and ask on #:keyboard:staff-chat for a staff member with a higher rank than yours to ban the player, mentioning the player, the rule they broke, and providing proof they actually broke the rules.


## **__2) Proper actions and punishments__**
__2.1) Griefing:__ Make sure the player is griefing and not clearing a griefed build to build their own build there, then freeze the player using `@freeze`, clear their latest block changes using `@purge`, and permanently ban them with a proper reason using `@ban`

__2.2) NSFW/inappropriate builds:__ Freeze the player using `@freeze`, clear their latest block changes using `@purge`, and permanently ban them with a proper reason using `@ban`

__2.3) Lag machines/Noise machines:__ First offense - warn the player using `@warn`. Second offense - add another warn, then temporarily ban the player using `@tempban` for at least a day. Third+ offenses: temporarily ban the player for at least a week.

__2.4) Annoying players:__ First offense - warn the player using `@warn`. Second offense - add another warn, then temporarily ban the player using `@tempban` for at least a day. Third+ offenses: temporarily ban the player for at least a week. Please note a difference between minor trolling, which is allowed to a certain extent, and being annoying. It is up to your judgement to decide when a player is being annoying, but please be reasonable (see also rule 1.3: Over-punishment)

__2.5) Bug abuse:__ First offense - warn the player using `@warn`, then send the bug on #:keyboard:staff-chat. Second offense -  add another warn, then temporarily ban the player using `@tempban` for at least a day. Third+ offenses: temporarily ban the player for at least a week.

__2.6) Shulker bans:__ First offense - warn the player using `@warn`. Second offense - permanently ban the player using `@ban`
