<<-- Build With Us Mod guidelines (Revision 2)-->>
Notice: These guidelines are subject to change at any time! Please be sure to update on them every once in a while.
**__1) General guidelines__**
__1.1) Following the rules:__ Normal rules still apply to staff members! Be sure to follow the normal rules!
__1.2) Staff abuse:__ Abusing your powers as staff member (for example: banning/kicking players without reason, using your powers to grief/annoy too much) may result in you getting demoted or banned from the plot.
__1.3) Over-punishment:__ Punishing players for little things or giving a punishment which is a lot harder than the fitting punishment may result in you getting demoted. (See also Section 2: Proper actions and punishments).
__1.4) Inactivity:__ Being inactive for too long on the plot may result in you getting demoted.
__1.5) Banlist/Warnlist flooding:__ Do not fill the banlist or the warnlist with unnecessary bans. For example, if you have banned a nonexistent player as a joke, be sure to unban them afterwards. Over-flooding the lists may result in you getting demoted.
__ 1.6) Punishment alteration:__ You may go a little over or under the punishments specifically mentioned in section 2, but do not give too harsh or too weak punishments. These guidelines aren't meant to be followed one-to-one but rather to be flexible and give general directions of how to punish and on what.
__1.7) Incapability to punish:__ If you have found a player breaking the rules but you are unable to give the proper punishment (for example: you are a JrMod and you saw a player griefing), warn the player using `@warn`, and ask on #:keyboard:staff-chat for a staff member with a higher rank than yours to ban the player, mentioning the player, the rule they broke, and providing proof they actually broke the rules.
**__2) Proper actions and punishments__**
__2.1) Griefing:__ Freeze the player using `@freeze`, Clear their latest block changes using `@purge`, and permanently ban them with a proper reason using `@ban`
